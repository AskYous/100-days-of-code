# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learning, Planning, and 1st Project Start

**Thoughts:** 

* I completed Day 16 of the [JS30 challenge](https://javascript30.com)
* I started the FreeCodeCamp [JS Certification Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)
* I started my "Meal Plan" web app. It is in this Github repo

I feel like things are starting to come together for me. I am creating this web app completely with Vanilla JS and creating page elements dynamically.

I am excited to see where this can go and how much I can accomplish in this manner. At this time the applications will use localStorage. Not sure if I am gong to hook it into a DB or Cookie. Will keep updated.

### Day 2: November 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learning

**Thoughts:** 

* I completed Day 17 of the [JS30 challenge](https://javascript30.com)
* I completed 80/110 Lessons in the FreeCodeCamp [JS Certification Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)

I got to work with 'map' and 'sort' more in today's JS30 challenge. I need to use these more as they have great utility in most projects.

### Day 3: November 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learning

**Thoughts:** 

* I completed Day 18 of the [JS30 challenge](https://javascript30.com)
* I completed 85/110 Lessons in the FreeCodeCamp [JS Certification Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)
* Worked on Meal Plan app more (part of this repo).
* * Got all sections to load and populate "home" button, as well as placeholder data
* * Need to debug heading not changing back when going home

I got to work with 'map' and 'reduce' more in today's JS30 challenge. I am understanding more and more how to use these functions.

I am enjoying creating a small project from scratch, and using what I have learned these last couple weeks. You really do need ot use things or you lose them, and not just use but use for a prupose.

### Day 4: November 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learning & More "Meal Planning"

**Thoughts:** 

* I completed Day 19 of the [JS30 challenge](https://javascript30.com)
* I completed 95/110 Lessons in the FreeCodeCamp [JS Certification Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)
* Worked on Meal Plan app more (part of this repo).
* * Refactored code to keep it DRY
* * Got the "Meal Plan" section to load the current date, first day of week, and a 'ul' with each day of the week and data attributes with the date attached.

I got to work with the webcam today in the JS30 challenge. Seeing how you can take a video stream and grab difference elements from it (i.e. the video, a still image, etc), and putting that in the canvas to manipulate.

Creating a simple UI/UX with JS, HTML, and CSS is pretty fun. I am learning a lot about the DOM and how to manipulate things. I like working in Vanilla JS so I can see how it is all functioning in the browser.

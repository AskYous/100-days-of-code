# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learning, Planning, and 1st Project Start

**Thoughts:** 

* I completed Day 16 of the [JS30 challenge](https://javascript30.com)
* I started the FreeCodeCamp [JS Certification Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)
* I started my "Meal Plan" web app. It is in this Github repo

I feel like things are starting to come together for me. I am creating this web app completely with Vanilla JS and creating page elements dynamically.

I am excited to see where this can go and how much I can accomplish in this manner. At this time the applications will use localStorage. Not sure if I am gong to hook it into a DB or Cookie. Will keep updated.

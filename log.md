# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learning, Planning, and 1st Project Start

**Thoughts:** 

* I completed Day 16 of the [JS30 challenge](https://javascript30.com)
* I started the FreeCodeCamp [JS Certification Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)
* I started my "Meal Plan" web app. It is in this Github repo

I feel like things are starting to come together for me. I am creating this web app completely with Vanilla JS and creating page elements dynamically.

I am excited to see where this can go and how much I can accomplish in this manner. At this time the applications will use localStorage. Not sure if I am gong to hook it into a DB or Cookie. Will keep updated.

### Day 2: November 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learning

**Thoughts:** 

* I completed Day 17 of the [JS30 challenge](https://javascript30.com)
* I completed 80/110 Lessons in the FreeCodeCamp [JS Certification Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)

I got to work with 'map' and 'sort' more in today's JS30 challenge. I need to use these more as they have great utility in most projects.

### Day 3: November 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learning

**Thoughts:** 

* I completed Day 18 of the [JS30 challenge](https://javascript30.com)
* I completed 85/110 Lessons in the FreeCodeCamp [JS Certification Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)
* Worked on Meal Plan app more (part of this repo).
* * Got all sections to load and populate "home" button, as well as placeholder data
* * Need to debug heading not changing back when going home

I got to work with 'map' and 'reduce' more in today's JS30 challenge. I am understanding more and more how to use these functions.

I am enjoying creating a small project from scratch, and using what I have learned these last couple weeks. You really do need ot use things or you lose them, and not just use but use for a prupose.

### Day 4: November 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learning & More "Meal Planning"

**Thoughts:** 

* I completed Day 19 of the [JS30 challenge](https://javascript30.com)
* I completed 95/110 Lessons in the FreeCodeCamp [JS Certification Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)
* Worked on Meal Plan app more (part of this repo).
* * Refactored code to keep it DRY
* * Got the "Meal Plan" section to load the current date, first day of week, and a 'ul' with each day of the week and data attributes with the date attached.

I got to work with the webcam today in the JS30 challenge. Seeing how you can take a video stream and grab difference elements from it (i.e. the video, a still image, etc), and putting that in the canvas to manipulate.

Creating a simple UI/UX with JS, HTML, and CSS is pretty fun. I am learning a lot about the DOM and how to manipulate things. I like working in Vanilla JS so I can see how it is all functioning in the browser.

### Day 5: November 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learning

**Thoughts:** 

* I completed Day20 of the [JS30 challenge](https://javascript30.com)

Today was a shorter day. It was busier at work and I had plans for the evening. I got to work with Speech Recognition in the browser. Took me a while to figure out it is only supported by Chrome though. 

I added a couple if states to check if the transcript included certain words. I made a simple "Jarvis" command that listened for the word "get" and then listened for "the traffic" or "the weather" and would return a certain response. I had to turn off "interimResults" to prevent it from firing several times. I may go back and figure out how to debounce, but couldn't figure it out effectively without messing with the speec recognition.

### Day 6: November 21, 2019


### Day 7: November 22, 2019


### Day 8: November 23, 2019


### Day 9: November 25, 2019


### Day 10: November 26, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Learning

**Thoughts:** 

* I completed Day 25 of the [JS30 challenge](https://javascript30.com) & the rest of the first Module in FreeCodeCamp's JS Cert (Basic JS)[https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/]

I was able to complete both of these efficiently today. The setup of some of the exercises in FreeCodeCamp is a little frustrating, but I understand why it is done the way it is.

* I worked on my 'Meal Plan App' tonight.

I was able to complete the implementation of setting the initial date upon loading the "Meal Plan Section" and make sure the previous and next buttons move back and forward one week each. The passed date is set to 12am and adjusted for prev/next week from there.

I completed the implementation of the test/dummy meal plan date. The meals load on the appropriate date because when loading the page the days of the week are set with a data attribute for their date (YYYY/MM/DD) and the dummy data uses an object with the date included.

There is also a link to a recipe if one is added. All of this is loaded into local storage and "stringified" then "parsed" when loaded.

Next is to add the ability to change/add a new meal which will tie into the "Meals Reference Page"
